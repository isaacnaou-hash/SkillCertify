The primary objective of our research is to evaluate the effectiveness of different teaching methodologies in higher education. We'll use a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews. The sample size includes three hundred participants from various academic departments. Data collection will occur over two semesters to ensure statistical significance. Our hypothesis suggests that interactive learning techniques improve student engagement by approximately twenty-five percent compared to traditional lecture formats. The control group will receive standard instruction, while the experimental group will participate in collaborative projects, case studies, and peer-to-peer learning activities.
