In today's meeting, we'll discuss our new product launch strategy. The target launch date is set for the beginning of next quarter. Our Digital Marketing department will lead the campaign with an estimated budget of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The product will initially be available in five major cities and features AI integration and voice control capabilities. We expect strong market reception based on our preliminary research. The team is confident about meeting our sales targets for the first quarter after launch.
