---------- Stage 1: Time to Build the App! ----------FROM node:20-alpine AS builder1. Define a Build Argument for the secret keyWe need the secret key to build the app! Make sure your deploy system passes this in (ARG).ARG PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY_ARGWORKDIR /appGotta install all the extra stuff (like Python/C++ headers) needed to compile libraries like 'canvas'.RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++ pkgconf cairo-dev jpeg-dev pango-dev giflib-dev pixman-devGrab the package files and install everything (all dependencies, even dev ones)!COPY package*.json ./RUN npm installCopy the whole project source code now.COPY . .2. Set the environment variable for the build scriptWe set the secret key here so the build script can actually see it (ENV). It's essential!ENV PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=$PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY_ARGBuild the whole thing—frontend, backend, all compiled!This is where our secret key gets embedded by esbuild.RUN npm run build---------- Stage 2: The Tiny Runner (This is what actually runs the website!) ----------Use a lean base image for productionFROM node:20-alpine AS runnerWORKDIR /appOnly install the absolute necessary libraries needed to run the compiled code (like 'canvas').RUN apk add --no-cache cairo jpeg pango giflib pixman1.
